# Starbucks_Capstone

This project is a capstone challenge from Data Scientist Nanodegree in Udacity. The dataset to be dealt with is simulated data on how customers make purchases and how their decisions affected by promotional offers in Starbucks. People in the simulation are provided with three different types of offers: buy-one-get-one(BOGO), discount and informational; and produce various events, including receiving offers, viewing offers and making purchases. Each person will have his or her own hidden traits on their purchasing patterns. The mask task of this project is to identify groups of people that share similar purchasing patterns and how well they are influenced by promotional offers.
